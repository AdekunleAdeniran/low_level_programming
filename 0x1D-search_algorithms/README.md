## 0x1D. C - Search Algorithms

**What you should learn from this project**

       At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to
       anyone, without the help of Google:

* What is a search algorithm
* What is a linear search
* What is a binary search
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

**0. Linear search**

     Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using
     the Linear search algorithm

* Prototype : int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
* Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
  size is the number of elements in array
* And value is the value to search for
* Your function must return the first index where value is located
* If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function
  must return -1
* Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching,
  you have to print this value (see example below)

**1. Binary search**

     Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers
     using the Binary search algorithm

* Prototype : int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
* Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
  size is the number of elements in array
* And value is the value to search for
* Your function must return the index where value is located
* You can assume that array will be sorted in ascending order
* You can assume that value wonâ€™t appear more than once in array
* If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function
  must return -1
* You must print the array being searched every time it changes.
  (e.g. at the beginning and when you search a subarray)
