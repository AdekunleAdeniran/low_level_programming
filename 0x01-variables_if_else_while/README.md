### Exercises
[0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c)
```
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is
executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored
in the variable n is positive or negative.
```
	You can find the source code here.
* The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this
  program
* You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not
  touch this code
* The output of the program should be:
* The number, followed by
      if the number is greater than 0: is positive
      if the number is 0: is zero
      if the number is less than 0: is negative
      followed by a new line

[1-last_digit.c](./1-last_digit.c)
